## Books that Just May Grant Super Powers
(without the need to consume radio active material or lie to your loved ones to "protect" them).

Summaries will be coming soon. I just have to get them written.

* Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts by Annie Duke
* Antifragile by Massim Taleb
* Black Box Thinking by Matthew Syed
* Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World by David Epstien (No, this one is not dead either)

## Random Course Notes
* [Learning How to Learn from Coursea:](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) 
	This course teaches you .. how to learn.  It's a meta course that is kind of a paradox.
	It covers topics such as the Illusion of Competence**, **Chunking**, **Memory**, and **Interleaving**.
