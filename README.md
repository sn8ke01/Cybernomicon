On going, ever growing list of notes without commentary (mostly).

## Recon Process

This is simple external recon process to kick off any pentest/assessment.

[Recon Process](Recon.md "Hail to the Recon")

## Active Directory

Collection of notes about AD, AD Recon, and AD Attack. 
[Gerneral AD Information](ActiveDirectory/README.md "The time loop starts here.")

## Phishing Attack Fundamentals

[Phishing Fundamentals](Phishing/README.md): This is phishing fundamentals and some other associated attack vector descriptions like multi-stage payload phishing attack. 

## Linux

Small collection  [Linux commands](Linux/Linux.md "Give me some Linux baby.")

I would like to grow this list into something that is a little more relevant to cyber but my time is as premium as a Tesla  Cyber Truck and I have a tendency to exaggerate every single little thing. 

## Technical Books

* [Real World Bug Hunting](Books/RealWorldBugHunting/Readme.md "The holistic approach to bug hunting!!"):
	This is somewhat of a field guide for Web Application bug bounty hunting.
	It uses disclosed reports of real-world bung hunts to teach the various vulnerabilities.

* [Attacking Network Protocols](Books/AttackingNetworkProtocols/README.md "How many roads must a man walk down?"): 
	This book teaches analysis techniques of the network traffic produced by an application.

## Scripting
Collection of scripts

## Books that Just May Grant Super Powers
(without the need to consume radio active material or lie to your loved ones to "protect" them).

Summaries will be coming soon. I just have to get them written.

* Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts by Annie Duke
* Antifragile by Massim Taleb
* Black Box Thinking by Matthew Syed
* Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World by David Epstien (No, this one is not dead either)

## Random Course Notes
* [Learning How to Learn from Coursea](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn "An Epic saga of meta learning.  They can take our tuna but they can never take our ability to learn!!") This course teaches you .. how to learn.  It's a meta course that is kind of a paradox.  It covers topics such as the Illusion of **Competence**, **Chunking**, **Memory**, and **Interleaving**.
